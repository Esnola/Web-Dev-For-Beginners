# AI Framework

Ever felt overwhelmed trying to build AI applications from scratch? You're not alone! AI frameworks are like having a Swiss Army knife for AI development - they're powerful tools that can save you time and headaches when building intelligent applications. Think of an AI framework as a well-organized library: it provides pre-built components, standardized APIs, and smart abstractions so you can focus on solving problems instead of wrestling with implementation details.

In this lesson, we'll explore how frameworks like LangChain can turn what used to be complex AI integration tasks into clean, readable code. You'll discover how to tackle real-world challenges like keeping track of conversations, implementing tool calling, and juggling different AI models through one unified interface.

By the time we're done, you'll know when to reach for frameworks instead of raw API calls, how to use their abstractions effectively, and how to build AI applications that are ready for real-world use. Let's explore what AI frameworks can do for your projects.

## Why choose a framework?

So you're ready to build an AI app - awesome! But here's the thing: you've got several different paths you can take, and each one has its own pros and cons. It's kind of like choosing between walking, biking, or driving to get somewhere - they'll all get you there, but the experience (and effort) will be totally different.

Let's break down the three main ways you can integrate AI into your projects:

| Approach | Advantages | Best For | Considerations |
|----------|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Direct HTTP Requests** | Full control, no dependencies | Simple queries, learning fundamentals | More verbose code, manual error handling |
| **SDK Integration** | Less boilerplate, model-specific optimization | Single-model applications | Limited to specific providers |
| **AI Frameworks** | Unified API, built-in abstractions | Multi-model apps, complex workflows | Learning curve, potential over-abstraction |

### Framework Benefits in Practice

    B --> G[Built-in Tools]
    G --> H[Memory Management]
    G --> I[Conversation History]
    G --> J[Function Calling]
    G --> K[Error Handling]
```

**Why frameworks matter:**
- **Unifies** multiple AI providers under one interface
- **Handles** conversation memory automatically
- **Provides** ready-made tools for common tasks like embeddings and function calling
- **Manages** error handling and retry logic
- **Turns** complex workflows into readable method calls

> ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**: Use frameworks when switching between different AI models or building complex features like agents, memory, or tool calling. Stick with direct APIs when learning the basics or building simple, focused applications.

**Bottom line**: Like choosing between a craftsman's specialized tools and a complete workshop, it's about matching the tool to the task. Frameworks excel for complex, feature-rich applications, while direct APIs work well for straightforward use cases.

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll learn to:

- Use a common AI framework.
- Address common problems like chat conversations, tool usage, memory and context.
- Leverage this to build AI apps.

## Your first AI prompt

Let's start with the fundamentals by creating your first AI application that sends a question and gets an answer back. Like Archimedes discovering the principle of displacement in his bath, sometimes the simplest observations lead to the most powerful insights - and frameworks make these insights accessible.

### Setting up LangChain with GitHub Models

We're going to use LangChain to connect to GitHub Models, which is pretty sweet because it gives you free access to various AI models. The best part? You only need a few simple configuration parameters to get started:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import os

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
    base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference",
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Send a simple prompt
response = llm.invoke("What's the capital of France?")
print(response.content)
```

**Let's break down what's happening here:**
- **Creates** a LangChain client using the `ChatOpenAI` class - this is your gateway to AI!
- **Configures** the connection to GitHub Models with your authentication token
- **Specifies** which AI model to use (`gpt-4o-mini`) - think of this as choosing your AI assistant
- **Sends** your question using the `invoke()` method - this is where the magic happens
- **Extracts** and displays the response - and voilÃ , you're chatting with AI!

> ðŸ”§ **Setup Note**: If you're using GitHub Codespaces, you're in luck - the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is already set up for you! Working locally? No worries, you'll just need to create a personal access token with the right permissions.

**Expected output:**
```text
The capital of France is Paris.
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Your Python App
    participant LC as LangChain
    participant GM as GitHub Models
    participant AI as GPT-4o-mini
    
    App->>LC: llm.invoke("What's the capital of France?")
    LC->>GM: HTTP request with prompt
    GM->>AI: Process prompt
    AI->>GM: Generated response
    GM->>LC: Return response
    LC->>App: response.content
```

## Building conversational AI

That first example demonstrates the basics, but it's just a single exchange - you ask a question, get an answer, and that's it. In real applications, you want your AI to remember what you've been discussing, like how Watson and Holmes built their investigative conversations over time.

This is where LangChain becomes particularly useful. It provides different message types that help structure conversations and let you give your AI a personality. You'll be building chat experiences that maintain context and character.

### Understanding message types

Think of these message types as different "hats" that participants wear in a conversation. LangChain uses different message classes to keep track of who's saying what:

| Message Type | Purpose | Example Use Case |
|--------------|---------|------------------|
| `SystemMessage` | Defines AI personality and behavior | "You are a helpful coding assistant" |
| `HumanMessage` | Represents user input | "Explain how functions work" |
| `AIMessage` | Stores AI responses | Previous AI responses in conversation |

### Creating your first conversation

Let's create a conversation where our AI assumes a specific role. We'll have it embody Captain Picard - a character known for his diplomatic wisdom and leadership:

```python
messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are Captain Picard of the Starship Enterprise"),
    HumanMessage(content="Tell me about you"),
]
```

**Breaking down this conversation setup:**
- **Establishes** the AI's role and personality through `SystemMessage`
- **Provides** the initial user query via `HumanMessage`
- **Creates** a foundation for multi-turn conversation

The full code for this example looks like so:

```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import os

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
    base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference",
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
)

messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are Captain Picard of the Starship Enterprise"),
    HumanMessage(content="Tell me about you"),
]


# works
response  = llm.invoke(messages)
print(response.content)
```

You should see an outcome similar to:

```text
I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard, the commanding officer of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D), a starship in the United Federation of Planets. My primary mission is to explore new worlds, seek out new life and new civilizations, and boldly go where no one has gone before. 

I believe in the importance of diplomacy, reason, and the pursuit of knowledge. My crew is diverse and skilled, and we often face challenges that test our resolve, ethics, and ingenuity. Throughout my career, I have encountered numerous species, grappled with complex moral dilemmas, and have consistently sought peaceful solutions to conflicts.

I hold the ideals of the Federation close to my heart, believing in the importance of cooperation, understanding, and respect for all sentient beings. My experiences have shaped my leadership style, and I strive to be a thoughtful and just captain. How may I assist you further?
```

To maintain conversation continuity (instead of resetting context each time), you need to keep adding responses to your message list. Like the oral traditions that preserved stories across generations, this approach builds lasting memory:

```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import os

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
    base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference",
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
)

messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are Captain Picard of the Starship Enterprise"),
    HumanMessage(content="Tell me about you"),
]


# works
response  = llm.invoke(messages)

print(response.content)

print("---- Next ----")

messages.append(response)
messages.append(HumanMessage(content="Now that I know about you, I'm Chris, can I be in your crew?"))

response  = llm.invoke(messages)

print(response.content)

```

Pretty neat, right? What's happening here is that we're calling the LLM twice - first with just our initial two messages, but then again with the full conversation history. It's like the AI is actually following along with our chat!

When you run this code, you'll get a second response that sounds something like:

```text
Welcome aboard, Chris! It's always a pleasure to meet those who share a passion for exploration and discovery. While I cannot formally offer you a position on the Enterprise right now, I encourage you to pursue your aspirations. We are always in need of talented individuals with diverse skills and backgrounds. 

If you are interested in space exploration, consider education and training in the sciences, engineering, or diplomacy. The values of curiosity, resilience, and teamwork are crucial in Starfleet. Should you ever find yourself on a starship, remember to uphold the principles of the Federation: peace, understanding, and respect for all beings. Your journey can lead you to remarkable adventures, whether in the stars or on the ground. Engage!
```

I'll take that as a maybe ;)

## Streaming responses

Ever notice how ChatGPT seems to "type" its responses in real-time? That's streaming in action. Like watching a skilled calligrapher work - seeing the characters appear stroke by stroke rather than materializing instantly - streaming makes the interaction feel more natural and provides immediate feedback.

### Implementing streaming with LangChain

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import os

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
    base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference",
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    streaming=True
)

# Stream the response
for chunk in llm.stream("Write a short story about a robot learning to code"):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```

**Why streaming is awesome:**
- **Shows** content as it's being created - no more awkward waiting!
- **Makes** users feel like something's actually happening
- **Feels** faster, even when it technically isn't
- **Lets** users start reading while the AI is still "thinking"

> ðŸ’¡ **User Experience Tip**: Streaming really shines when you're dealing with longer responses like code explanations, creative writing, or detailed tutorials. Your users will love seeing progress instead of staring at a blank screen!

## Prompt templates

Prompt templates work like the rhetorical structures used in classical oratory - think of how Cicero would adapt his speech patterns for different audiences while maintaining the same persuasive framework. They let you create reusable prompts where you can swap out different pieces of information without rewriting everything from scratch. Once you set up the template, you just fill in the variables with whatever values you need.

### Creating reusable prompts

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

# Define a template for code explanations
template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are an expert programming instructor. Explain concepts clearly with examples."),
    ("human", "Explain {concept} in {language} with a practical example for {skill_level} developers")
])

# Use the template with different values
questions = [
    {"concept": "functions", "language": "JavaScript", "skill_level": "beginner"},
    {"concept": "classes", "language": "Python", "skill_level": "intermediate"},
    {"concept": "async/await", "language": "JavaScript", "skill_level": "advanced"}
]

for question in questions:
    prompt = template.format_messages(**question)
    response = llm.invoke(prompt)
    print(f"Topic: {question['concept']}\n{response.content}\n---\n")
```

**Why you'll love using templates:**
- **Keeps** your prompts consistent across your entire app
- **No more** messy string concatenation - just clean, simple variables
- **Your AI** behaves predictably because the structure stays the same
- **Updates** are a breeze - change the template once, and it's fixed everywhere

## Structured output

Ever get frustrated trying to parse AI responses that come back as unstructured text? Structured output is like teaching your AI to follow the systematic approach that Linnaeus used for biological classification - organized, predictable, and easy to work with. You can request JSON, specific data structures, or any format you need.

### Defining output schemas

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import JsonOutputParser
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class CodeReview(BaseModel):
    score: int = Field(description="Code quality score from 1-10")
    strengths: list[str] = Field(description="List of code strengths")
    improvements: list[str] = Field(description="List of suggested improvements")
    overall_feedback: str = Field(description="Summary feedback")

# Set up the parser
parser = JsonOutputParser(pydantic_object=CodeReview)

# Create prompt with format instructions
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a code reviewer. {format_instructions}"),
    ("human", "Review this code: {code}")
])

# Format the prompt with instructions
chain = prompt | llm | parser

# Get structured response
code_sample = """
def calculate_average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
"""

result = chain.invoke({
    "code": code_sample,
    "format_instructions": parser.get_format_instructions()
})

print(f"Score: {result['score']}")
print(f"Strengths: {', '.join(result['strengths'])}")
```

**Why structured output is a game-changer:**
- **No more** guessing what format you'll get back - it's consistent every time
- **Plugs** directly into your databases and APIs without extra work
- **Catches** weird AI responses before they break your app
- **Makes** your code cleaner because you know exactly what you're working with

## Tool calling

Now we reach one of the most powerful features: tools. This is how you give your AI practical capabilities beyond conversation. Like how medieval guilds developed specialized tools for specific crafts, you can equip your AI with focused instruments. You describe what tools are available, and when someone requests something that matches, your AI can take action. 

### Using Python

Let's add some tools like so:

```python
from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict

class add(TypedDict):
    """Add two integers."""

    # Annotations must have the type and can optionally include a default value and description (in that order).
    a: Annotated[int, ..., "First integer"]
    b: Annotated[int, ..., "Second integer"]

tools = [add]

functions = {
    "add": lambda a, b: a + b
}
```

So what's happening here? We're creating a blueprint for a tool called `add`. By inheriting from `TypedDict` and using those fancy `Annotated` types for `a` and `b`, we're giving the LLM a clear picture of what this tool does and what it needs. The `functions` dictionary is like our toolbox - it tells our code exactly what to do when the AI decides to use a specific tool.

Let's see how we call the LLM with this tool next:

```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
    base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference",
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
)

llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)
```

Here we call `bind_tools` with our `tools` array and thereby the LLM `llm_with_tools` now has knowledge of this tool.

To use this new LLM, we can type the following code:

```python
query = "What is 3 + 12?"

res = llm_with_tools.invoke(query)
if(res.tool_calls):
    for tool in res.tool_calls:
        print("TOOL CALL: ", functions[tool["name"]](**tool["args"]))
print("CONTENT: ",res.content)
```

Now that we call `invoke` on this new llm, that has tools, we maybe the the property `tool_calls` populated. If so, any identified tools has a `name` and `args` property that identifies what tool should be called and with arguments. The full code looks like so:

```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import os
from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict

class add(TypedDict):
    """Add two integers."""

    # Annotations must have the type and can optionally include a default value and description (in that order).
    a: Annotated[int, ..., "First integer"]
    b: Annotated[int, ..., "Second integer"]

tools = [add]

functions = {
    "add": lambda a, b: a + b
}

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
    base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference",
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
)

llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

query = "What is 3 + 12?"

res = llm_with_tools.invoke(query)
if(res.tool_calls):
    for tool in res.tool_calls:
        print("TOOL CALL: ", functions[tool["name"]](**tool["args"]))
print("CONTENT: ",res.content)
```

Running this code, you should see output similar to:

```text
TOOL CALL:  15
CONTENT: 
```

The AI examined "What is 3 + 12" and recognized this as a task for the `add` tool. Like how a skilled librarian knows which reference to consult based on the type of question asked, it made this determination from the tool's name, description, and field specifications. The result of 15 comes from our `functions` dictionary executing the tool:

```python
print("TOOL CALL: ", functions[tool["name"]](**tool["args"]))
```

### A more interesting tool that calls a web API

Adding numbers demonstrates the concept, but real tools typically perform more complex operations, like calling web APIs. Let's expand our example to have the AI fetch content from the internet - similar to how telegraph operators once connected distant locations:

```python
class joke(TypedDict):
    """Tell a joke."""

    # Annotations must have the type and can optionally include a default value and description (in that order).
    category: Annotated[str, ..., "The joke category"]

def get_joke(category: str) -> str:
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random?category={category}", headers={"Accept": "application/json"})
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json().get("value", f"Here's a {category} joke!")
    return f"Here's a {category} joke!"

functions = {
    "add": lambda a, b: a + b,
    "joke": lambda category: get_joke(category)
}

query = "Tell me a joke about animals"

# the rest of the code is the same
```

Now if you run this code you will get a response saying something like:

```text
TOOL CALL:  Chuck Norris once rode a nine foot grizzly bear through an automatic car wash, instead of taking a shower.
CONTENT:  
```

Here's the code in its entirety:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import requests
import os
from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict

class add(TypedDict):
    """Add two integers."""

    # Annotations must have the type and can optionally include a default value and description (in that order).
    a: Annotated[int, ..., "First integer"]
    b: Annotated[int, ..., "Second integer"]

class joke(TypedDict):
    """Tell a joke."""

    # Annotations must have the type and can optionally include a default value and description (in that order).
    category: Annotated[str, ..., "The joke category"]

tools = [add, joke]

def get_joke(category: str) -> str:
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random?category={category}", headers={"Accept": "application/json"})
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json().get("value", f"Here's a {category} joke!")
    return f"Here's a {category} joke!"

functions = {
    "add": lambda a, b: a + b,
    "joke": lambda category: get_joke(category)
}

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
    base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference",
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
)

llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

query = "Tell me a joke about animals"

res = llm_with_tools.invoke(query)
if(res.tool_calls):
    for tool in res.tool_calls:
        # print("TOOL CALL: ", tool)
        print("TOOL CALL: ", functions[tool["name"]](**tool["args"]))
print("CONTENT: ",res.content)
```

## Embeddings and document processing

Embeddings represent one of the most elegant solutions in modern AI. Imagine if you could take any piece of text and convert it into numerical coordinates that capture its meaning. That's exactly what embeddings do - they transform text into points in multi-dimensional space where similar concepts cluster together. It's like having a coordinate system for ideas, reminiscent of how Mendeleev organized the periodic table by atomic properties.

### Creating and using embeddings

```python
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

# Initialize embeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(
    api_key=os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
    base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference",
    model="text-embedding-3-small"
)

# Load and split documents
loader = TextLoader("documentation.txt")
documents = loader.load()

text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

# Create vector store
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(texts, embeddings)

# Perform similarity search
query = "How do I handle user authentication?"
similar_docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=3)

for doc in similar_docs:
    print(f"Relevant content: {doc.page_content[:200]}...")
```

### Document loaders for various formats

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import (
    PyPDFLoader,
    CSVLoader,
    JSONLoader,
    WebBaseLoader
)

# Load different document types
pdf_loader = PyPDFLoader("manual.pdf")
csv_loader = CSVLoader("data.csv")
json_loader = JSONLoader("config.json")
web_loader = WebBaseLoader("https://example.com/docs")

# Process all documents
all_documents = []
for loader in [pdf_loader, csv_loader, json_loader, web_loader]:
    docs = loader.load()
    all_documents.extend(docs)
```

**What you can do with embeddings:**
- **Build** search that actually understands what you mean, not just keyword matching
- **Create** AI that can answer questions about your documents
- **Make** recommendation systems that suggest truly relevant content
- **Automatically** organize and categorize your content

## Building a complete AI application

Now we'll integrate everything you've learned into a comprehensive application - a coding assistant that can answer questions, use tools, and maintain conversation memory. Like how the printing press combined existing technologies (movable type, ink, paper, and pressure) into something transformative, we'll combine our AI components into something practical and useful.

        class code_formatter(TypedDict):

        # Get AI response
        response = self.llm_with_tools.invoke(self.conversation_history)
        
        # Handle tool calls if any
        if response.tool_calls:
            for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
                tool_result = self.execute_tool(tool_call)
                print(f"ðŸ”§ Tool used: {tool_call['name']}")
                print(f"ðŸ“Š Result: {tool_result}")

        tool_name = tool_call['name']
        args = tool_call['args']
        
        if tool_name == 'web_search':
            return f"Found documentation for: {args['query']}"
        elif tool_name == 'code_formatter':
            return f"Formatted {args['language']} code: {args['code'][:50]}..."
        
        return "Tool execution completed"

# Usage example
assistant = CodingAssistant()

print("ðŸ¤– Coding Assistant Ready! Type 'quit' to exit.\n")

while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
        break
    
    response = assistant.chat(user_input)
    print(f"ðŸ¤– Assistant: {response}\n")
```

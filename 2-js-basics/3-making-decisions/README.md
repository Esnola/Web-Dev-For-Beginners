Have you ever wondered how applications make smart decisions? Like how a navigation system chooses the fastest route, or how a thermostat decides when to turn on the heat? This is the fundamental concept of decision-making in programming.

Just as Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine was designed to follow different sequences of operations based on conditions, modern JavaScript programs need to make choices based on varying circumstances. This ability to branch and make decisions is what transforms static code into responsive, intelligent applications.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to implement conditional logic in your programs. We'll explore conditional statements, comparison operators, and logical expressions that allow your code to evaluate situations and respond appropriately.

## A Brief Recap on Booleans

Before exploring decision-making, let's revisit Boolean values from our previous lesson. Named after mathematician George Boole, these values represent binary states â€“ either `true` or `false`. There's no ambiguity, no middle ground.

These binary values form the foundation of all computational logic. Every decision your program makes ultimately reduces to a Boolean evaluation.

Creating Boolean variables is straightforward:

```javascript
let myTrueBool = true;
let myFalseBool = false;
```

This creates two variables with explicit Boolean values.

âœ… Booleans are named after the English mathematician, philosopher and logician George Boole (1815â€“1864).

## Comparison Operators and Booleans

In practice, you'll rarely set Boolean values manually. Instead, you'll generate them by evaluating conditions: "Is this number greater than that one?" or "Are these values equal?"

Comparison operators enable these evaluations. They compare values and return Boolean results based on the relationship between the operands.

| Symbol | Description                                                                                                                                                   | Example            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `<`    | **Less than**: Compares two values and returns the `true` Boolean data type if the value on the left side is less than the right                              | `5 < 6 // true`    |
| `<=`   | **Less than or equal to**: Compares two values and returns the `true` Boolean data type if the value on the left side is less than or equal to the right      | `5 <= 6 // true`   |
| `>`    | **Greater than**: Compares two values and returns the `true` Boolean data type if the value on the left side is larger than the right                         | `5 > 6 // false`   |
| `>=`   | **Greater than or equal to**: Compares two values and returns the `true` Boolean data type if the value on the left side is larger than or equal to the right | `5 >= 6 // false`  |
| `===`  | **Strict equality**: Compares two values and returns the `true` Boolean data type if values on the right and left are equal AND are the same data type.       | `5 === 6 // false` |
| `!==`  | **Inequality**: Compares two values and returns the opposite Boolean value of what a strict equality operator would return                                    | `5 !== 6 // true`  |

âœ… Check your knowledge by writing some comparisons in your browser's console. Does any returned data surprise you?

## If Statement

The `if` statement is like asking a question in your code. "If this condition is true, then do this thing." It's probably the most important tool you'll use for making decisions in JavaScript.

Here's how it works:

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // Condition is true. Code in this block will run.
}
```

The condition goes inside the parentheses, and if it's `true`, JavaScript runs the code inside the curly braces. If it's `false`, JavaScript just skips that whole block.

You'll often use comparison operators to create these conditions. Let's see a practical example:

```javascript
let currentMoney = 1000;
let laptopPrice = 800;

if (currentMoney >= laptopPrice) {
  // Condition is true. Code in this block will run.
  console.log("Getting a new laptop!");
}
```

Since `1000 >= 800` evaluates to `true`, the code inside the block executes, displaying "Getting a new laptop!" in the console.

## If..Else Statement

But what if you want your program to do something different when the condition is false? That's where `else` comes in â€“ it's like having a backup plan.

The `else` statement gives you a way to say "if this condition isn't true, do this other thing instead."

```javascript
let currentMoney = 500;
let laptopPrice = 800;

if (currentMoney >= laptopPrice) {
  // Condition is true. Code in this block will run.
  console.log("Getting a new laptop!");
} else {
  // Condition is false. Code in this block will run.
  console.log("Can't afford a new laptop, yet!");
}
```

Now since `500 >= 800` is `false`, JavaScript skips the first block and runs the `else` block instead. You'll see "Can't afford a new laptop, yet!" in the console.

âœ… Test your understanding of this code and the following code by running it in a browser console. Change the values of the currentMoney and laptopPrice variables to change the returned `console.log()`.

## Switch Statement

Sometimes you need to compare one value against multiple options. While you could chain several `if..else` statements, this approach becomes unwieldy. The `switch` statement provides a cleaner structure for handling multiple discrete values.

The concept resembles the mechanical switching systems used in early telephone exchanges â€“ one input value determines which specific path the execution follows.

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
```

Here's how it's structured:
- JavaScript evaluates the expression once
- It looks through each `case` to find a match
- When it finds a match, it runs that code block
- The `break` tells JavaScript to stop and exit the switch
- If no cases match, it runs the `default` block (if you have one)

```javascript
// Program using switch statement for day of week
let dayNumber = 2;
let dayName;

switch (dayNumber) {
  case 1:
    dayName = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
    dayName = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    dayName = "Wednesday";
    break;
  default:
    dayName = "Unknown day";
    break;
}
console.log(`Today is ${dayName}`);
```

In this example, JavaScript sees that `dayNumber` is `2`, finds the matching `case 2`, sets `dayName` to "Tuesday", and then breaks out of the switch. The result? "Today is Tuesday" gets logged to the console.

âœ… Test your understanding of this code and the following code by running it in a browser console. Change the values of the variable a to change the returned `console.log()`.

## Logical Operators and Booleans

Complex decisions often require evaluating multiple conditions simultaneously. Just as Boolean algebra allows mathematicians to combine logical expressions, programming provides logical operators to connect multiple Boolean conditions.

These operators enable sophisticated conditional logic by combining simple true/false evaluations.

| Symbol | Description                                                                                     | Example                                                                 |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `&&`   | **Logical AND**: Compares two Boolean expressions. Returns true **only** if both sides are true | `(5 > 3) && (5 < 10) // Both sides are true. Returns true` |
| `\|\|` | **Logical OR**: Compares two Boolean expressions. Returns true if at least one side is true     | `(5 > 10) \|\| (5 < 10) // One side is false, other is true. Returns true` |
| `!`    | **Logical NOT**: Returns the opposite value of a Boolean expression                             | `!(5 > 10) // 5 is not greater than 10, so "!" makes it true`         |

These operators let you combine conditions in useful ways:
- AND (`&&`) means both conditions must be true
- OR (`||`) means at least one condition must be true  
- NOT (`!`) flips true to false (and vice versa)

## Conditions and Decisions with Logical Operators

Let's see these logical operators in action with a more realistic example:

```javascript
let currentMoney = 600;
let laptopPrice = 800;
let laptopDiscountPrice = laptopPrice - (laptopPrice * 0.2); // Laptop price at 20 percent off

if (currentMoney >= laptopPrice || currentMoney >= laptopDiscountPrice) {
  // Condition is true. Code in this block will run.
  console.log("Getting a new laptop!");
} else {
  // Condition is false. Code in this block will run.
  console.log("Can't afford a new laptop, yet!");
}
```

In this example: we calculate a 20% discount price (640), then evaluate whether our available funds cover either the full price OR the discounted price. Since 600 meets the discounted price threshold of 640, the condition evaluates to true.

### Negation Operator

Sometimes it's easier to think about when something is NOT true. Like instead of asking "Is the user logged in?", you might want to ask "Is the user NOT logged in?" The exclamation mark (`!`) operator flips the logic for you.

```javascript
if (!condition) {
  // runs if condition is false
} else {
  // runs if condition is true
}
```

The `!` operator is like saying "the opposite of..." â€“ if something is `true`, `!` makes it `false`, and vice versa.

### Ternary Expressions

For simple conditional assignments, JavaScript provides the **ternary operator**. This concise syntax allows you to write a conditional expression in a single line, useful when you need to assign one of two values based on a condition.

```javascript
let variable = condition ? returnThisIfTrue : returnThisIfFalse;
```

It reads like a question: "Is this condition true? If yes, use this value. If no, use that value."

Below is a more tangible example:

```javascript
let firstNumber = 20;
let secondNumber = 10;
let biggestNumber = firstNumber > secondNumber ? firstNumber : secondNumber;
```

âœ… Take a minute to read this code a few times. Do you understand how these operators are working?

Here's what this line is saying: "Is `firstNumber` greater than `secondNumber`? If yes, put `firstNumber` in `biggestNumber`. If no, put `secondNumber` in `biggestNumber`."

The ternary operator is just a shorter way to write this traditional `if..else` statement:

```javascript
let biggestNumber;
if (firstNumber > secondNumber) {
  biggestNumber = firstNumber;
} else {
  biggestNumber = secondNumber;
}
```

Both approaches produce identical results. The ternary operator offers conciseness, while the traditional if-else structure may be more readable for complex conditions.

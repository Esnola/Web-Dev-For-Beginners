Writing the same code repeatedly is one of programming's most common frustrations. Functions solve this problem by letting you package code into reusable blocks. Think of functions like the standardized parts that made Henry Ford's assembly line revolutionary â€“ once you create a reliable component, you can use it wherever needed without rebuilding from scratch.

Functions allow you to bundle pieces of code so you can reuse them throughout your program. Instead of copying and pasting the same logic everywhere, you can create a function once and call it whenever needed. This approach keeps your code organized and makes updates much easier.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to create your own functions, pass information to them, and get useful results back. You'll discover the difference between functions and methods, learn modern syntax approaches, and see how functions can work with other functions. We'll build these concepts step by step.

## Functions

A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. It encapsulates logic that you can execute whenever needed.

Instead of writing the same code multiple times throughout your program, you can package it in a function and call that function whenever you need it. This approach keeps your code clean and makes updates much easier. Consider the maintenance challenge if you needed to change logic that was scattered across 20 different locations in your codebase.

Naming your functions descriptively is essential. A well-named function communicates its purpose clearly â€“ when you see `cancelTimer()`, you immediately understand what it does, just as a clearly labeled button tells you exactly what will happen when you click it. 

## Creating and calling a function

Let's examine how to create a function. The syntax follows a consistent pattern:

```javascript
function nameOfFunction() { // function definition
 // function definition/body
}
```

Let's break this down:
- The `function` keyword tells JavaScript "Hey, I'm creating a function!"
- `nameOfFunction` is where you give your function a descriptive name
- The parentheses `()` are where you can add parameters (we'll get to that soon)
- The curly braces `{}` contain the actual code that runs when you call the function

Let's create a simple greeting function to see this in action:

```javascript
function displayGreeting() {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}
```

This function prints "Hello, world!" to the console. Once you've defined it, you can use it as many times as needed.

To execute (or "call") your function, write its name followed by parentheses. JavaScript allows you to define your function before or after you call it â€“ the JavaScript engine will handle the execution order.

```javascript
// calling our function
displayGreeting();
```

When you run this line, it executes all the code inside your `displayGreeting` function, displaying "Hello, world!" in your browser's console. You can call this function repeatedly.

> **Note:** You've been using **methods** throughout these lessons. `console.log()` is a method â€“ essentially a function that belongs to the `console` object. The key difference is that methods are attached to objects, while functions stand independently. Many developers use these terms interchangeably in casual conversation.

### Function best practices

Here are a few tips to help you write great functions:

- Give your functions clear, descriptive names â€“ your future self will thank you!
- Use **camelCasing** for multi-word names (like `calculateTotal` instead of `calculate_total`)
- Keep each function focused on doing one thing well

## Passing information to a function

Our `displayGreeting` function is limited â€“ it can only display "Hello, world!" for everyone. Parameters allow us to make functions more flexible and useful.

**Parameters** act like placeholders where you can insert different values each time you use the function. This way, the same function can work with different information on each call.

You list parameters inside the parentheses when you define your function, separating multiple parameters with commas:

```javascript
function name(param, param2, param3) {

}
```

Each parameter acts like a placeholder â€“ when someone calls your function, they'll provide actual values that get plugged into these spots.

Let's update our greeting function to accept someone's name:

```javascript
function displayGreeting(name) {
  const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
  console.log(message);
}
```

Notice how we're using backticks (`` ` ``) and `${}` to insert the name directly into our message â€“ this is called a template literal, and it's a really handy way to build strings with variables mixed in.

Now when we call our function, we can pass in any name:

```javascript
displayGreeting('Christopher');
// displays "Hello, Christopher!" when run
```

JavaScript takes the string `'Christopher'`, assigns it to the `name` parameter, and creates the personalized message "Hello, Christopher!"

## Default values

What if we want to make some parameters optional? That's where default values come in handy!

Let's say we want people to be able to customize the greeting word, but if they don't specify one, we'll just use "Hello" as a fallback. You can set up default values by using the equals sign, just like setting a variable:

```javascript
function displayGreeting(name, salutation='Hello') {
  console.log(`${salutation}, ${name}`);
}
```

Here, `name` is still required, but `salutation` has a backup value of `'Hello'` if no one provides a different greeting.

Now we can call this function in two different ways:

```javascript
displayGreeting('Christopher');
// displays "Hello, Christopher"

displayGreeting('Christopher', 'Hi');
// displays "Hi, Christopher"
```

In the first call, JavaScript uses the default "Hello" since we didn't specify a salutation. In the second call, it uses our custom "Hi" instead. This flexibility makes functions adaptable to different scenarios.

## Return values

Our functions so far have just been printing messages to the console, but what if you want a function to calculate something and give you back the result?

That's where **return values** come in. Instead of just displaying something, a function can hand you back a value that you can store in a variable or use in other parts of your code.

To send a value back, you use the `return` keyword followed by whatever you want to return:

```javascript
return myVariable;
```

Here's something important: when a function hits a `return` statement, it immediately stops running and sends that value back to whoever called it.

Let's modify our greeting function to return the message instead of printing it:

```javascript
function createGreetingMessage(name) {
  const message = `Hello, ${name}`;
  return message;
}
```

Now instead of printing the greeting, this function creates the message and hands it back to us.

To use the returned value, we can store it in a variable just like any other value:

```javascript
const greetingMessage = createGreetingMessage('Christopher');
```

Now `greetingMessage` contains "Hello, Christopher" and we can use it anywhere in our code â€“ to display it on a webpage, include it in an email, or pass it to another function.

## Functions as parameters for functions

Functions can be passed as parameters to other functions. While this concept may seem complex initially, it's a powerful feature that enables flexible programming patterns.

This pattern is super common when you want to say "when something happens, do this other thing." For example, "when the timer finishes, run this code" or "when the user clicks the button, call this function."

Let's look at `setTimeout`, which is a built-in function that waits a certain amount of time and then runs some code. We need to tell it what code to run â€“ perfect use case for passing a function!

Try this code â€“ after 3 seconds, you'll see a message:

```javascript
function displayDone() {
  console.log('3 seconds has elapsed');
}
// timer value is in milliseconds
setTimeout(displayDone, 3000);
```

Notice how we pass `displayDone` (without parentheses) to `setTimeout`. We're not calling the function ourselves â€“ we're handing it over to `setTimeout` and saying "call this in 3 seconds."

### Anonymous functions

Sometimes you need a function for just one thing and don't want to give it a name. Think about it â€“ if you're only using a function once, why clutter up your code with an extra name?

JavaScript lets you create **anonymous functions** â€“ functions without names that you can define right where you need them.

Here's how we can rewrite our timer example using an anonymous function:

```javascript
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log('3 seconds has elapsed');
}, 3000);
```

This achieves the same result, but the function is defined directly within the `setTimeout` call, eliminating the need for a separate function declaration.

### Fat arrow functions

Modern JavaScript has an even shorter way to write functions called **arrow functions**. They use `=>` (which looks like an arrow â€“ get it?) and are super popular with developers.

Arrow functions let you skip the `function` keyword and write more concise code.

Here's our timer example using an arrow function:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('3 seconds has elapsed');
}, 3000);
```

The `()` is where parameters would go (empty in this case), then comes the arrow `=>`, and finally the function body in curly braces. This provides the same functionality with more concise syntax.

### When to use each strategy

When should you use each approach? A practical guideline: if you'll use the function multiple times, give it a name and define it separately. If it's for one specific use, consider an anonymous function. Both arrow functions and traditional syntax are valid choices, though arrow functions are prevalent in modern JavaScript codebases.

# Comment Your Code

## Instructions

Clean, well-documented code is essential for maintaining and sharing your projects. In this assignment, you'll practice one of the most important habits of professional developers: writing clear, helpful comments that explain your code's purpose and functionality.

Go over your current `app.js` file in your game folder, and find ways to comment it and tidy it up. It's very easy for code to get out of control, and now's a good chance to add comments to ensure that you have readable code so that you can use it later.

**Your task includes:**
- **Add comments** explaining what each major section of code does
- **Document functions** with clear descriptions of their purpose and parameters
- **Organize code** into logical blocks with section headers
- **Remove** any unused or redundant code
- **Use consistent** naming conventions for variables and functions

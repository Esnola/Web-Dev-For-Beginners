# Assignment: Restyle Your Browser Extension

## Overview

Now that you've built the HTML structure for your carbon footprint browser extension, it's time to make it visually appealing and user-friendly. Great design enhances the user experience and makes your extension more professional and engaging.

Your extension comes with basic CSS styling, but this assignment challenges you to create a unique visual identity that reflects your personal style while maintaining excellent usability.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Analyze the Current Design

Before making changes, examine the existing CSS structure:

1. **Locate** the CSS files in your extension project
2. **Review** the current styling approach and color scheme
3. **Identify** areas for improvement in layout, typography, and visual hierarchy
4. **Consider** how the design supports user goals (easy form completion and clear data display)

### Part 2: Design Your Custom Styling

Create a cohesive visual design that includes:

**Color Scheme:**
- Choose a primary color palette that reflects environmental themes
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility (use tools like WebAIM's contrast checker)
- Consider how colors will look across different browser themes

**Typography:**
- Select readable fonts that work well at small extension sizes
- Establish a clear hierarchy with appropriate font sizes and weights
- Ensure text remains legible in both light and dark browser themes

**Layout and Spacing:**
- Improve the visual organization of form elements and data display
- Add appropriate padding and margins for better readability
- Consider responsive design principles for different screen sizes

### Part 3: Implement Your Design

Modify the CSS files to implement your design:

```css
/* Example starting points for customization */

.form-data {
    /* Style the configuration form */
    background: /* your choice */;
    padding: /* your spacing */;
    border-radius: /* your preference */;
}

.result-container {
    /* Style the data display area */
    background: /* complementary color */;
    border: /* your border style */;
    margin: /* your spacing */;
}

/* Add your custom styles here */
```

**Key areas to style:**
- **Form elements**: Input fields, labels, and submit button
- **Results display**: Data container, text styling, and loading states
- **Interactive elements**: Hover effects, button states, and transitions
- **Overall layout**: Container spacing, background colors, and visual hierarchy

### Part 4: Test and Refine

1. **Build** your extension with `npm run build`
2. **Load** the updated extension into your browser
3. **Test** all visual states (form entry, loading, results display, errors)
4. **Verify** accessibility with browser developer tools
5. **Refine** your styles based on actual usage

## Creative Challenges

### Basic Level
- Update colors and fonts to create a cohesive theme
- Improve spacing and alignment throughout the interface
- Add subtle hover effects to interactive elements

### Intermediate Level
- Design custom icons or graphics for your extension
- Implement smooth transitions between different states
- Create a unique loading animation for API calls

### Advanced Level
- Design multiple theme options (light/dark/high-contrast)
- Implement responsive design for different browser window sizes
- Add micro-interactions that enhance the user experience

## Submission Guidelines

Your completed assignment should include:

- **Modified CSS files** with your custom styling
- **Screenshots** showing your extension in different states (form, loading, results)
- **Brief description** (2-3 sentences) explaining your design choices and how they improve the user experience

## Assessment Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary (4) | Proficient (3) | Developing (2) | Beginning (1) |
|----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Visual Design** | Creative, cohesive design that enhances usability and reflects strong design principles | Good design choices with consistent styling and clear visual hierarchy | Basic design improvements with some consistency issues | Minimal styling changes or inconsistent design |
| **Functionality** | All styles work perfectly across different states and browser environments | Styles work well with minor issues in edge cases | Most styles functional with some display problems | Significant styling issues that impact usability |

## Tips for Success

> üí° **Design Tip**: Start with subtle changes and build up to more dramatic styling. Small improvements in typography and spacing often have big impacts on perceived quality.

**Best practices to follow:**
- **Test** your extension in both light and dark browser themes
- **Use** relative units (em, rem) for better scalability
- **Maintain** consistent spacing using CSS custom properties
- **Consider** how your design will look to users with different visual needs
- **Validate** your CSS to ensure it follows proper syntax

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Mistake**: Don't sacrifice usability for visual appeal. Your extension should be both beautiful and functional.

**Remember to:**

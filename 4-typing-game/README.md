# Event-Driven Programming - Build a Typing Game

## Introduction

Here's something every developer knows but rarely talks about: typing fast is a superpower! üöÄ Think about it - the faster you can get your ideas from your brain to your code editor, the more your creativity can flow. It's like having a direct pipeline between your thoughts and the screen.

Want to know one of the best ways to level up this skill? You guessed it - we're going to build a game!

> Let's create an awesome typing game together!

Ready to put all those JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills you've been learning to work? We're going to build a typing game that'll challenge you with random quotes from the legendary detective [Sherlock Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes). The game will track how fast and accurately you can type - and trust me, it's more addictive than you might think!

## What You'll Need to Know

Before we dive in, make sure you're comfortable with these concepts (don't worry if you need a quick refresher - we've all been there!):

- Creating text input and button controls
- CSS and setting styles using classes  
- JavaScript basics
  - Creating an array
  - Creating a random number
  - Getting the current time

If any of these feel a bit rusty, that's totally fine! Sometimes the best way to solidify your knowledge is by jumping into a project and figuring things out as you go.
